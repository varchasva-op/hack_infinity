🧩 What each import means
Import	From	Purpose (how to explain to judges)
fitz	PyMuPDF	Reads text and images directly from PDF pages.
pytesseract	OCR tool	Reads handwriting or text from images if the PDF has scanned pages.
streamlit	Web app framework	Creates interactive UI and dashboard easily in Python.
openai	OpenAI API	Uses pre-trained GPT models to generate flashcards, quizzes, and answers.
sentence-transformers	Hugging Face	Creates embeddings for semantic search (used in our RAG chatbot).
faiss	Facebook AI Library	Performs fast similarity search to find relevant study notes for a question.
gtts	Google Text-to-Speech	Converts text answers or flashcards into spoken audio (mp3).
langchain	AI agent framework	Handles prompt formatting and future multi-agent orchestration.
fastapi	API framework	Optional: if we extend to backend APIs later.
tinydb	Lightweight database	Stores progress, scores, and small user data locally.
pillow (PIL)	Image library	Helps manipulate images for OCR.

You can say in presentation:

“We used Streamlit for the web interface, PyMuPDF and Tesseract for reading notes, OpenAI’s GPT models for generating educational content, and FAISS with SentenceTransformers for semantic search in our doubt-solving module.”s

⚙️ What happens step-by-step when the app runs

User uploads a PDF
→ reader.py extracts text → splits into paragraphs.

Flashcard Agent (flashcard.py)
→ Sends text chunks to GPT model → receives Q/A cards.

Quiz Agent (quiz.py)
→ Creates adaptive quizzes with multiple choice answers.

Planner Agent (planner.py)
→ Makes a revision schedule using date + topic.

Chat Agent (RAG) (chat.py)
→ Converts all text into embeddings (SentenceTransformer)
→ Uses FAISS to find the most relevant chunks
→ Passes them to GPT → contextual answer.

Voice Agent (voice.py)
→ Converts flashcard answers into audio for revision.

Gamification & Dashboard
→ Shows progress, XP, streak, and saved outputs.
